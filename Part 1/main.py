In summary, all four countries have seen an overall rose in the number of people that are living in the cities in the period shown. Philippines have had a decline between 1990 to 2010 in the percentage of the population living in the urban, but they've managed to bounce back.



Indonesia and Malaysia have had the highest rise in the proportion of people living in cities, with Malaysia having an almost 75% rate in that regard in 2020.Â  Also Indonesia has seen a 38% increase in the percentages of people living in the urban, going from around 12% in 1970 to 50% by the end of 2020 in that regard and having the second highest proportion by 2010.



While both Philippines and Thailand have seen an overall increase in the proportion of population living in cities, they both have had a knock along the way. Most notably, Philippines had a decline of almost 10% in their rates between the year of 1990 and 2010 and Thailand had a steady 30% rate starting from 1990 untill 2020."""
