    "student_essay": "One of the hot topics these day is about how the working week needs to be shorter and the need of longer weekends. However while I believe that people need to have enough time to rest after their working period, I don't think they need longer weekends to achieve that.\n\n\nFirstly, I think that there is plenty of time to rest after you get off from your work and prepare for the next day. Secondly, longer weekends will make people lazy and distant from their work. For example, when I was working at a tech company, we used to have 4 days off and when we would get back to work the connection I had with my job and colleagues didn't feel the same as I was feeling distant with my job and felt the urge to be done with the work as quickly as possible so I can go back home. Thirdly, I read a recent study that discussed the impact of cutting working hours on the economy which showed massive damage to that country's economy in the long run.\n\n\nThere are several ways to improve your lifestyle while not having longer weekends. Most people tend to not plan their weekends at all and that can damage the quality of their time off. Good planning will guide you to find better use of you quality time and setting the goals you want to achieve by a certain time. One of the best ways to make your job experience better is to find coworkers with the same interest as you. this was the case for me as I was having a rough few weeks at work but then ended up meeting one of my best friends who also loved soccer as much as I did and we used to discuss about our opinion on different topics which made the working experience much better for both of us.\n\n\nIn conclusion, I think while occasionally we need a time off from work to get into a better head space, there are other ways to tackle this problem without the need of cutting working days and making the weekends longer.",
    "original_question": "The working week should be shorter and workers should have a longer weekend.\n\nDo you agree or disagree. ",
    "task_response": "**1. What You Did Well:**\nYou successfully identified the core topic of the question and presented a clear and consistent position (disagreement) from the introduction through to the conclusion. You provided several relevant arguments to support your stance, such as the potential for laziness, the economic impact of reduced working hours, and the idea that current time off is sufficient if managed well. Your use of a personal anecdote to illustrate the point about becoming distant from work was a good attempt at providing specific support.\n\n**2. What You Could Have Done Better:**\nWhile your position was clear, some of your supporting points could have been more directly and strongly linked to the central argument against a shorter working week and longer weekend. For example, the point about finding coworkers with similar interests, while a valid way to improve job experience, doesn't directly argue against the *need* for a shorter working week or longer weekend in terms of rest or productivity. Its connection to the prompt's core argument was a bit indirect. Additionally, your reference to a \"recent study\" about economic impact, while a strong point, lacked specificity, which can weaken its persuasive power in terms of Task Response.\n\n**3. What You Missed:**\nYou did not completely miss any part of the prompt. You clearly addressed the \"agree or disagree\" aspect and provided reasons for your stance. The areas for improvement relate more to the depth and directness of the development of some ideas rather than an omission of a task component.\n\n**4. Recommendations for Improvement:**\n*   Before writing, ensure that every main idea and supporting example you plan to include directly and unequivocally supports your overall position. Ask yourself: \"How does this specific point or example directly prove why I agree or disagree with the prompt?\"\n*   When using external evidence or studies, try to be more specific if possible (e.g., \"Research from [institution] suggests...\") or frame it as a widely accepted concept if specific details are unavailable (e.g., \"It is widely understood that...\"). Avoid vague references like \"I read a recent study.\"\n*   Elaborate more fully on your main points. For instance, when you state there's \"plenty of time to rest,\" expand on *how* that time can be effectively utilized to achieve the desired rest, rather than just stating the fact.\n\n**5. Suggested Edits to Your Original Text:**\n\n*   **Your Original Sentence:** \"Firstly, I think that there is plenty of time to rest after you get off from your work and prepare for the next day.\"\n    *   **Higher-Scoring Alternative for Task Response:** \"Firstly, I contend that the current working structure already provides ample opportunity for rest and recuperation. Individuals can effectively manage their evenings and existing weekends to engage in leisure activities, pursue hobbies, and spend quality time with family, thereby mitigating the need for an extended break.\"\n\n*   **Your Original Sentence:** \"Thirdly, I read a recent study that discussed the impact of cutting working hours on the economy which showed massive damage to that country's economy in the long run.\"\n    *   **Higher-Scoring Alternative for Task Response:** \"Furthermore, a significant concern is the potential negative impact on national economies. Economic analyses often indicate that a reduction in working hours can lead to decreased productivity, higher operational costs for businesses, and ultimately, a decline in overall economic output, posing a long-term threat to prosperity.\"\n\n*   **Your Original Sentence:** \"One of the best ways to make your job experience better is to find coworkers with the same interest as you. this was the case for me as I was having a rough few weeks at work but then ended up meeting one of my best friends who also loved soccer as much as I did and we used to discuss about our opinion on different topics which made the working experience much better for both of us.\"\n    *   **Higher-Scoring Alternative for Task Response:** \"Beyond simply extending leisure time, improving job satisfaction itself can significantly enhance overall well-being, thereby reducing the perceived need for a shorter working week. For instance, fostering a positive work environment and encouraging social connections among colleagues can make the workday more enjoyable and less draining. My own experience, where forming friendships with colleagues who shared common interests like soccer transformed a challenging period into a more positive one, illustrates how internal workplace dynamics can be more impactful than simply increasing time away from work.\"\n\n**6. Final Task Response Score:** 7",
    "coherence_and_cohesion": "**1. What You Did Well:**\nYour essay was clearly organized into an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, which provides a basic structure for your ideas. You also attempted to use linking words to introduce your points within the first body paragraph.\n\n**2. What You Could Have Done Better:**\nThe primary weakness in your essay's Coherence and Cohesion lies in the organization of your body paragraphs. Your first body paragraph is very long and contains three distinct arguments, which makes it difficult for the reader to follow a single, developed idea. The logical progression between your first and second body paragraphs is also not entirely smooth, as the second paragraph introduces a new line of argument (alternatives to longer weekends) rather than directly developing the reasons against them. Furthermore, your use of cohesive devices is somewhat mechanical and repetitive.\n\n**3. Cohesion and Coherence Breakdown:**\n*   **Paragraphing:** Your first body paragraph is a significant issue. It attempts to present three separate main ideas (\"plenty of time to rest,\" \"longer weekends make people lazy,\" and \"impact on economy\") within a single paragraph. For greater clarity and to allow for proper development of each point, these should have been separated into individual paragraphs. The second body paragraph also contains two distinct ideas (planning weekends and finding like-minded colleagues) that could benefit from clearer separation or more explicit linking.\n*   **Linking Words:** You rely heavily on \"Firstly,\" \"Secondly,\" and \"Thirdly\" to introduce points within one long paragraph. While these are cohesive devices, their repetitive use in this manner makes the writing feel mechanical rather than fluid. There is an underuse of a wider range of more sophisticated linking words and phrases that could show more complex relationships between sentences and paragraphs (e.g., cause and effect, contrast, further addition, exemplification). The transition from the first body paragraph to the second is abrupt, lacking a clear linking phrase to signal the shift in focus.\n*   **Referencing:** Referencing is generally clear (e.g., \"this\" referring to finding coworkers with the same interest). However, some phrasing like \"I was feeling distant with my job and felt the urge to be done with the work\" could be more concise to avoid slight repetition.\n\n**4. Recommendations for Improvement:**\n*   **Plan your paragraphs carefully:** Before you start writing, create a brief outline. Assign one central idea to each body paragraph. This will help you ensure that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence and develops a single argument thoroughly.\n*   **Vary your cohesive devices:** Expand your repertoire of linking words and phrases. Instead of just \"Secondly,\" consider using alternatives like \"Furthermore,\" \"Moreover,\" \"In addition to this,\" or \"Another significant point is that...\" to introduce new ideas. Use transition words to show the relationship between sentences (e.g., \"consequently,\" \"as a result,\" \"in contrast,\" \"however,\" \"for instance\").\n*   **Ensure logical progression between paragraphs:** Think about how each paragraph connects to the one before it and how it contributes to your overall argument. Use clear topic sentences and transitional phrases at the beginning of paragraphs to guide the reader smoothly from one idea to the next. For an \"agree/disagree\" essay, ensure your body paragraphs consistently support your stated stance.\n\n**5. Suggested Edits to Your Original Text:**\n\n*   **Original Body Paragraph 1:**\n    \"Firstly, I think that there is plenty of time to rest after you get off from your work and prepare for the next day. Secondly, longer weekends will make people lazy and distant from their work. For example, when I was working at a tech company, we used to have 4 days off and when we would get back to work the connection I had with my job and colleagues didn't feel the same as I was feeling distant with my job and felt the urge to be done with the work as quickly as possible so I can go back home. Thirdly, I read a recent study that discussed the impact of cutting working hours on the economy which showed massive damage to that country's economy in the long run.\"\n\n*   **Higher-Scoring Alternative for Coherence and Cohesion (showing improved paragraphing and linking):**\n\n    \"To begin with, I believe that the current working week already provides sufficient time for individuals to rest and prepare for the following day. There is ample opportunity within the existing structure for personal rejuvenation without the need for extended weekends.\n\n    **Moreover,** a key concern is that longer weekends could inadvertently lead to a decline in productivity and a sense of detachment from one's profession. **For example,** during my experience at a tech company where we occasionally had four-day weekends, I observed that upon returning to work, both I and my colleagues often felt a diminished connection to our tasks, leading to a desire to complete work as quickly as possible rather than engaging deeply.\n\n    **Beyond individual impact,** there are significant economic considerations. I recently read a study that highlighted the substantial long-term damage inflicted upon a country's economy when working hours were significantly reduced, suggesting that such policies can have far-reaching negative consequences.\"\n\n*   **Original Body Paragraph 2:**\n    \"There are several ways to improve your lifestyle while not having longer weekends. Most people tend to not plan their weekends at all and that can damage the quality of their time off. Good planning will guide you to find better use of you quality time and setting the goals you want to achieve by a certain time.

Many individuals fail to plan their time off, which often diminishes its restorative potential; conversely, thoughtful planning can lead to more fulfilling and productive leisure.\n\n    **Furthermore,** fostering positive social connections within the workplace can dramatically improve job satisfaction, thereby reducing the perceived need for longer breaks. This was certainly true in my own experience: after a challenging period at work, I connected with a colleague who shared my passion for soccer. Our discussions on various topics not only made the working environment more enjoyable but also fostered a stronger sense of belonging, making the work experience much more positive for both of us.\"\n\n**6. Final Coherence and Cohesion Score:** 5",
    "lexical_resource": "**1. What You Did Well:**\nYou have used some basic topic-specific vocabulary related to work and leisure, such as 'working week', 'weekends', 'time off', and 'economy'. You also attempted to use some phrases to express your opinion, like 'I believe that' and 'I don't think'.\n\n**2. What You Could Have Done Better:**\nThe essay relies heavily on a limited range of vocabulary, leading to repetition and a lack of precision. Many phrases are informal or colloquial, which is not appropriate for an academic essay. There is a consistent lack of sophisticated vocabulary and an absence of less common lexical items. Word choice and collocations are frequently unnatural, making the text sound less fluent and professional.\n\n**3. Lexical Resource Breakdown:**\n\n*   **Repetition:**\n    *   The word \"work/working\" is used excessively (e.g., \"working week,\" \"working period,\" \"get off from your work,\" \"back to work,\" \"my job,\" \"the work,\" \"working hours,\" \"at work,\" \"working experience,\" \"from work,\" \"working days\").\n    *   \"Time\" is repeated frequently (e.g., \"enough time,\" \"plenty of time,\" \"time off,\" \"quality time\").\n    *   \"Better\" is overused (e.g., \"better use,\" \"make your job experience better,\" \"better for both of us,\" \"better head space\").\n    *   \"Need\" is repeated (e.g., \"needs to be shorter,\" \"need of longer weekends,\" \"people need to have,\" \"we need a time off,\" \"without the need of cutting\").\n    *   \"Feel/feeling\" is repeated in the same sentence: \"didn't feel the same as I was feeling distant.\"\n\n*   **Word Choice/Collocation:**\n    *   \"hot topics these day\" - \"these days\" is correct, but \"hot topics\" is informal. Consider \"a widely debated issue\" or \"a prominent discussion point.\"\n    *   \"the need of longer weekends\" - Should be \"the need *for* longer weekends.\"\n    *   \"get off from your work\" - More natural would be \"finish work\" or \"leave work.\"\n    *   \"make people lazy and distant from their work\" - \"Foster laziness and detachment from their professional responsibilities\" would be more precise. \"Distant from their work\" is awkward.\n    *   \"the connection I had with my job and colleagues didn't feel the same as I was feeling distant with my job\" - Very repetitive and unnatural. Consider \"I felt a diminished connection to my role and colleagues, experiencing a sense of detachment.\"\n    *   \"felt the urge to be done with the work as quickly as possible\" - \"Felt compelled to complete tasks swiftly.\"\n    *   \"massive damage to that country's economy\" - \"Massive damage\" is informal. Use \"significant detriment\" or \"severe adverse impact.\"\n    *   \"improve your lifestyle while not having longer weekends\" - \"Enhance one's lifestyle without necessarily extending weekends.\"\n    *   \"damage the quality of their time off\" - \"Detract from the quality of their leisure time.\"\n    *   \"Good planning will guide you to find better use of you quality time\" - \"Effective planning can enable individuals to make better use of their leisure time.\" (\"you quality time\" is a grammatical error, should be \"your\").\n    *   \"make your job experience better\" - \"Enhance one's professional experience.\"\n    *   \"having a rough few weeks at work\" - \"Rough\" is informal. Consider \"experiencing a challenging period at work.\"\n    *   \"discuss about our opinion\" - \"Discuss our opinion\" (no \"about\").\n    *   \"get into a better head space\" - \"Head space\" is informal. Consider \"achieve a more positive mental state\" or \"improve one's well-being.\"\n    *   \"tackle this problem\" - \"Address this issue\" or \"resolve this challenge.\"\n\n*   **Spelling/Word Formation:**\n    *   \"these day\" (should be \"these days\")\n    *   \"you quality time\" (should be \"your quality time\")\n\n**4. Recommendations for Improvement:**\n*   **Expand your vocabulary range:** Actively learn synonyms and antonyms for common words. For example, instead of just \"good\" or \"bad,\" learn \"beneficial,\" \"detrimental,\" \"advantageous,\" \"adverse,\" etc.\n*   **Focus on precision:** Choose words that convey your meaning exactly. For instance, instead of \"big problem,\" use \"significant issue\" or \"major challenge.\"\n*   **Improve collocation awareness:** Pay attention to how words naturally go together. Use a collocation dictionary or notice common phrases in authentic English texts. For example, \"make a decision,\" not \"do a decision.\"\n*   **Elevate your style:** Avoid informal language and colloquialisms in academic writing. Replace phrases like \"get off from your work\" or \"rough few weeks\" with more formal alternatives.\n*   **Practice paraphrasing:** When you write, try to rephrase ideas using different vocabulary to avoid repetition.\n\n**5.

Final Lexical Resource Score:** 5",
    "grammatical_range_and_accuracy": "**1. What You Did Well:**\nYou have demonstrated a good attempt at using a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentence structures. There is clear evidence of complex sentences, particularly those using subordinate clauses (e.g., \"while I believe that...\", \"when I was working...\") and relative clauses (e.g., \"that discussed...\", \"who also loved...\"). This shows a good range in your grammatical structures. You also successfully use introductory phrases and clauses, often followed by correct punctuation.\n\n**2. What You Could Have Done Better:**\nWhile you attempt complex structures, there are frequent grammatical errors that, though often minor, accumulate and affect overall accuracy. These errors include issues with articles, prepositions, singular/plural forms, and occasional tense inconsistencies. Some very long sentences become slightly unwieldy, indicating a need for more precise control over highly complex constructions and better punctuation to manage their flow.\n\n**3. Grammatical Range and Accuracy Breakdown:**\n*   **Sentence Structure:** You effectively use a variety of sentence types, moving beyond simple sentences to incorporate complex ones. This includes sentences with noun clauses (\"how the working week needs to be shorter\"), adverbial clauses of time and concession (\"when I was working...\", \"while I believe...\"), and relative clauses (\"that discussed...\", \"who also loved...\"). This demonstrates a good range. However, some sentences are excessively long, which can lead to awkward phrasing and a slight loss of clarity, suggesting that while you attempt complex structures, full control over their most intricate forms is still developing.\n*   **Grammatical Errors:**\n    *   **Articles:** You sometimes omit or misuse articles, for example, \"a time off\" should be \"time off.\"\n    *   **Prepositions:** There are recurring errors with prepositions, such as \"the need of longer weekends\" (should be \"the need for\"), \"get off from your work\" (should be \"get off work\"), \"distant with my job\" (should be \"distant from my job\"), and \"discuss about our opinion\" (should be \"discuss our opinion\").\n    *   **Singular/Plural:** You used \"these day\" instead of \"these days\" and \"our opinion on different topics\" instead of \"our opinions on different topics.\"\n    *   **Tense Consistency:** In the sentence \"so I can go back home,\" the present tense \"can\" is inconsistent with the past context of the narrative (\"when I was working...\"). It should be \"so that I could go back home.\"\n    *   **Word Choice/Phrasing:** Phrases like \"tend to not plan\" could be more naturally expressed as \"tend not to plan.\" \"use of you quality time\" should be \"use of your quality time.\"\n*   **Punctuation:**\n    *   You occasionally miss commas after introductory clauses (e.g., \"However while I believe...\" should be \"However, while I believe...\").\n    *   There is a significant run-on sentence due to a lack of capitalization and appropriate punctuation: \"this was the case for me as I was having a rough few weeks at work but then ended up meeting one of my best friends who also loved soccer as much as I did and we used to discuss about our opinion on different topics which made the working experience much better for both of us.\" This sentence is too long and should be broken up or use a semicolon.\n\n**4. Recommendations for Improvement:**\n*   **Focus on Prepositions and Articles:** Dedicate specific practice to common prepositional phrases and the rules for using 'a,' 'an,' and 'the,' especially with abstract nouns or general statements.\n*   **Review Singular/Plural Nouns:** Pay close attention to whether nouns should be singular or plural, particularly when referring to general concepts or multiple items.\n*   **Master Complex Sentence Punctuation:** Practice using commas correctly with dependent and independent clauses. Learn how to use semicolons to connect closely related independent clauses, or how to split very long sentences into two or more shorter, clearer ones.\n*   **Ensure Tense Consistency:** When narrating events or discussing past experiences, ensure that all verbs maintain a consistent tense unless there's a specific reason for a shift.\n*   **Proofread Systematically:** After writing, review your essay specifically for one type of grammatical error at a time (e.g., first check all prepositions, then all articles, then all subject-verb agreements).\n\n**5.
